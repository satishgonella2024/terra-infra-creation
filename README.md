# Terraform Infrastructure Pipeline for WordPress Application

Welcome to the **Terraform Infrastructure Pipeline** project! This repository automates the provisioning of a robust, scalable, and highly available infrastructure for deploying a WordPress application in the AWS cloud, all while adhering to enterprise-grade best practices.

---

## 🏗️ Features

- **Modular Design**: Reusable Terraform modules for compute, networking, security, storage, and load balancing.
- **Enterprise-Grade Practices**: Version-controlled infrastructure with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
- **AWS Integration**: Utilizes AWS services including EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling Groups, and S3 for backend state management.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments.
- **High Availability**: Leverages AWS Availability Zones for fault tolerance and reliability.
- **Secure by Default**: Implements best practices for security groups and data protection.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform v1.9.x or later.  
   [Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)  
2. **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account and appropriate IAM permissions.  
3. **Jenkins**: Set up Jenkins for running the pipeline (optional for automation).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:satishgonella2024/terra-infra-creation.git
cd terra-infra-creation
```

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=terraform-state-bucket-eg" \
  -backend-config="key=terra-wordpress/terraform.tfstate" \
  -backend-config="region=eu-west-2"
```

### Validate the Configuration

```bash
terraform validate
```

### Plan the Infrastructure

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev/terraform.tfvars
```

### Apply Changes

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev/terraform.tfvars -auto-approve
```

## 📜 Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **Jenkins**, which performs the following stages:

1. **Checkout Code**: Clones the repository.
2. **Initialize Terraform**: Prepares the backend and downloads necessary plugins.
3. **Validate Terraform**: Ensures the configuration is syntactically valid.
4. **Plan Infrastructure**: Generates a plan detailing the changes to the infrastructure.
5. **Apply Changes**: Provisions the infrastructure in AWS.
6. **Post Actions**: Archives the Terraform state file for future use.

## 🌟 Highlights

### Modular Architecture
Each resource group—networking, security, compute, and load balancer—is encapsulated in a dedicated module for easy reusability and maintenance.

### AWS S3 Backend
State management is secured using an S3 bucket with DynamoDB for state locking, ensuring safe collaboration.

### Scalable Design
With Auto Scaling Groups and multiple availability zones, the infrastructure is ready to handle varying workloads.

### Secure Defaults
Security groups are configured to expose only essential ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) while restricting unnecessary access.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

1. **Pipeline Fails at Initialization**:
   - Verify AWS credentials are correctly configured in Jenkins.
   - Ensure the S3 bucket for the backend exists.

2. **Plan Errors**:
   - Confirm all required variables are defined in `terraform.tfvars`.

3. **Apply Issues**:
   - Check for service limits in your AWS account.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **application pipelines** for WordPress deployment.
- Add monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
- Migrate to **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** for advanced CI/CD.
- Enhance security with **AWS WAF** and **SSL/TLS**.
